# Word Categories

There are three main categories of words,
 - Function words
 - Context words
 - Unique words

These categories are not make-or-break for the power rating of an particular word.  This is more of "on average" these words are this powerful.  A Function word can be promoted through it's use to be more powerful than a unique word.  Similarly, a unique word can be demoted.

## Function Words

Function words have the lowest value.  They are more often times filler words.  Words that make language conform to some structure.

## Content Words

Content words have a middle value.  Some times they are super important.  Other times they are worth less than function words.  In general, they create the context, hold the detail and define relationships between words to create a bigger picture.

## Unique Words

Unique words are truly important.  They are the main idea words or powerful actions, names or objects (NOT to be confused with nouns haha).
