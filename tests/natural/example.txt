Perhaps one of these days I'll get back to this formulation, but until that day comes, there'll
just be more tangentially related points that somehow make it to my head.  The following is
actually from earlier in September sometime (2018).  I was in a mandhir thinking about how I
learned about most of what I know about my religion and it hit me that learning is a balance of
two folds (not exactly the best wording, but..)
1. Predictive through experience.
2. Learning meaning through association.  There are an infinite number of ways to learn, but what
I'm proposing is that they all stem to fill in the gaps that have in the above two areas.  That is
essentially the "WHAT" that we're trying to learn.  The two words that need to be "defined" to
"make sense" of those two ideas are EXPERIENCE and ASSOCIATION.
I can't focus much anymore or I just don't want to, so I'll leave this like this for now.  But
last point, language is simply a channel to communicate the more important things.  Just don't
forget that in the NLP Quest...
